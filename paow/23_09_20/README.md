PAOW! #16 - Keys into Clouds

In this experiment we play keys generated by approximate limit points of the logistic map.
Over the course of the 40 minutes the r parameter of the logistic map ascends from 3.49 to 3.86, crossing several regions of chaotic and oscillatory behavior.

We plug the microphone input into VCV rack and in particular the Audible Instruments Texture Synthesizer, mimicking the well-known rings into clouds patch for extra ambient goodness.

Enjoy!
