PAOW! #14 - Ghost Rehearsal

Pianists spend most of their time rehearsing rather than performing live on stage. Still, the rehearsal process remains understudied. As part of an ongoing research project, we have been collecting recordings of rehearsal sessions since Fall 2020.

This experiment presents three excerpts of rehearsal sessions recorded between 2020 and 2022 on a Yamaha GB1K Silent, an acoustic grand piano fitted with optical sensors that allow to capture key movements and convert them to MIDI. 

The three excerpts are:

1. W. A. Mozart: Twelve Variations on "Ah vous dirai-je, Maman", K 265. This piece was used as a warmup. It was played at a slow tempo and the most salient lines (both in the right and left hands) are played staccato, to practice finger independence.
2. J. Brahms: Hungarian Dance No. 5 (Primo Part). This section corresponds to rehearsals of the piece, in preparation for a live demo at the Falling Walls Science Summit in Berlin in Novemeber 2021.
3. S. Rachmaninoff: Piano Concerto No. 3 Op. 30 1st mov (solo piano part). This corresponds to a runthrough of the first movement, playing it from memory and trying to avoid pauses as much as possible. Afterwards, there is a little bit of cleanup of some of the sections that did not work that well throughout the runthrough.

Enjoy!
