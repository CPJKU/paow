PAOW! #25 

In this experiment, we reharmonize each voice of the Kyrie of the medieval "Messe de Nostre Dame" by Guillaume de Machault using an evolutionary algorithm based on the simplest and most restrictive four part writing rules in Paul Hindemith's "A Concentrated Course in Traditional Harmony".

Enjoy!
