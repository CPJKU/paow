PAOW! #22 - The Easiest Button To Button

In this experiment we play an entire piece with a single button: a MIDI pitch is mapped to whatever the next onset is in a given piece. When a note of this pitch is played on a controller, the notes at the next onset in the piece are then played with the velocity and articulation of the input note. With this code you can play entire sonatas with only one finger, or we can have some other process - like a double pendulum in this stream - mimick the finger.
