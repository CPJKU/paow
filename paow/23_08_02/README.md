For this experiment, we generate a MIDI file with increasing numbers of simultaneous notes at increasing tempos.
Setting the "MIDI IN Delay" of the Disklavier to on make the grand piano shut down when too many simultaneous notes arrive. We turn it off for this experiment, which means the notes are handled as fast as possible and for many simultaneous notes, strange rhythms emerge. 

Enjoy!
