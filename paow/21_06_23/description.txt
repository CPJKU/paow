This experiment automatically transcribes solo piano performances with a modified version of the high-resolution transcription model [Kong et al.]. 
The transcribed MIDI files contain detailed note onset and offset timing, as well as pedal information. 
We stream transcribed music selected from ATEPP dataset [Zhang et al.], which contains virtuoso piano performances of the Western classical repertoire.  

Enjoy!
