This experiment generates a MIDI file with octave-doubled arpeggios made of stacked major and minor thirds.
Whether the next third is major or minor as well as the root pitch is randomly sampled.
The tempo starts at ~0.25 notes/sec and over the course of one hour is increased to 16 notes/sec.
The sustain pedal is controlled by sinusoid curves with varying frequency constants.

Enjoy!
