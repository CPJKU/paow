PAOW! #26 - Eisenbahnereien

In this experiment, we cross-synthesize the grand piano with the sounds inside a train from Vienna to Milano.
The piano plays the Markov chain of Euclidean rhythms in PAOW! #12 and the cross-synthesis variant is implemented in supercollider and recorded in realtime.

Enjoy!
