# The Limits of the Age of Reproduction

This PAOW! is a technical exercise investigating the limits of reproduction of the Disklavier.

First, each note is played at different MIDI velocities. The audio for this part will be analyzed to create a dictionary of sounds of the Disklavier for later experiments.

Afterwards, we explore the speed limits of the hammer actuators of the Disklavier, by playing repeated notes with increasing speed and velocity. This experiment will be useful to assess how fast can the piano play, and whether there are reproduction differences at different MIDI velocities.
