In this experiment, we play an adaptation of Steve Reich's Piano Phase. This is a piece for two grand pianos, exactly the number of MIDI-addressable piano instruments within the Disklavier: one piano is played on the mechanical keys, the other on a built-in virtual piano.

Piano Phase consists of three sections with rough measure counts and the performers stay at phase shifted but stable positions for a bit in between continously phasing rhythms. In our adaptation each section is about 15 minutes long and the phase shift is continuous throughout.

Enjoy!
