# PAOW!

PAOW! is a series of experiments with our computer-controlled grand piano and computer-generated music.
PAOW! streams every Wednesday at 6 pm CET from our offices in Vienna on this youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/@paowcpjku

This repository contains the code used to generate the experiments. The folder is structure is paow/paow/_DATE_OF_STREAM_

Each experiment is self-contained and _should_ document its dependencies.
